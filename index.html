          <h2>Introduction to Sharks</h2>
          <p>
            Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a
            cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the
            head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern
            sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii)
            and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some
            sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including
            extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a
            shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans
            such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian
            Period (419–359 million years), though some fossilized
            chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician
            (458–444 million years ago).[1] The oldest modern sharks
            (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic, about 200 million
            years ago.

        <h2>Shark sizes</h2>

        <p>
          Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus
          perryi), a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in
          length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the
          world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.[2]
          They are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres
          (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, although there
          are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river
          shark, which can be found in both seawater and freshwater.[3] Sharks
          have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from
          damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics.
          They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at
          the top of their food chain. Select examples include the tiger shark,
          blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and
          hammerhead shark.
        </p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The etymology of the word shark is uncertain, the most likely
          etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of
          "predator, one who preys on others" from the Dutch schurk, meaning
          'villain, scoundrel' (cf. card shark, loan shark, etc.), which was
          later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.[8]
        </p>
        <p>
          The oldest total-group chondrichthyans, known as acanthodians or
          "spiny sharks", appeared during the Early Silurian, around 439 million
          years ago.[11] The oldest confirmed members of Elasmobranchii sensu
          lato (the group containing all cartilaginous fish more closely related
          to modern sharks and rays than to chimaeras) appeared during the
          Devonian.[12] The oldest representatives of Neoselachii, the group
          containing modern sharks (Selachii) and rays (Batoidea) to the
          exclusion of most extinct elasmobranch groups, date to the
          Permian.[13][14] Selachiimorpha and Batoidea are suggested to have
          diverged during the Triassic.[15] The oldest modern sharks date to the
          Early Jurassic, with most modern orders appearing by the end of the
          Jurassic.[16] Selachians largely replaced the hybodonts, which had
          previously been dominant group of shark-like fish during the Triassic
          and Early Jurassic.[17]
        </p>

        <p>
          Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many
          shark populations are threatened by human activities. Since 1970,
          shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from
          overfishing.[5]
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          The classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in
          search of food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live
          far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely to have
          their own distinct personalities.[82] Even solitary sharks meet for
          breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover
          thousands of miles in a year.[83] Shark migration patterns may be even
          more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean
          basins. Sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools.
          Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around
          seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California.[37]
          Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip
          sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.[70]
          When approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display. This
          usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can vary in
          intensity according to the threat level.[84]

        <h2>Types of Sharks</h2>
        <p>
          There are numerous species of sharks, each adapted to their
          environment. Below are some common types:

        <h3><strong>Sharks and their diet</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Whale Shark</strong>: Primarily feeds on plankton, small
            fish, and tiny marine organisms filtered through its gills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Great White Shark</strong>: Carnivorous predator that feeds
            on fish (like tuna), seals, sea lions, dolphins, and even small
            whales.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tiger Shark</strong>: Known as the "garbage can of the sea"
            because it eats a wide variety of prey, including fish, birds,
            seals, smaller sharks, squid, turtles, and even things like
            discarded trash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bull Shark</strong>: Feeds on fish (including other sharks),
            dolphins, and even terrestrial mammals when near the shoreline, like
            birds and dogs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hammerhead Shark</strong>: Prefers rays, but also consumes
            fish, smaller sharks, squid, and crustaceans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mako Shark</strong>: Predominantly eats bony fishes like
            mackerel, tuna, and bonito. They will also eat squid and smaller
            sharks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blacktip Shark</strong>: Eats smaller fish primarily, like
            sardines, herring, and anchovies, but will also eat crustaceans and
            cephalopods.

        <h4><em>Speed</em></h4>
        <p>
          In general, sharks swim ("cruise") at an average speed of 8 kilometres
          per hour (5.0 mph), but when feeding or attacking, the average shark
          can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour (12 mph). The
          shortfin mako shark, the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish,
          can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour (31 mph).[85] The
          great white shark is also capable of speed bursts. These exceptions
          may be due to the warm-blooded, or homeothermic, nature of these
          sharks' physiology. Sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day.[86]
        </p>
        <h4><em>Intelligence</em></h4>
        <p>
          Sharks possess brain-to-body mass ratios that are similar to mammals
          and birds,[87] and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior
          resembling play in the wild.[88][89] There is evidence that juvenile
          lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of
          novel objects in their environment.[90]
        </p>
        <h4><em>Sleep</em></h4>
        <p>
          All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for
          them to breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do
          this. Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using
          their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them
          to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes
          remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of
          divers swimming around them[91] and as such they are not truly asleep.
          Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a
          process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially
          unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny
          dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates
          swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and
          this also may be the case in larger shark species.[91] In 2016 a great
          white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state
          researchers believed was sleep swimming.[92]
